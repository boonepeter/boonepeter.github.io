The annual ARVO conference began on Sunday morning. This was the first time the conference was in person since 2019 and it was clear people were excited to be back in person.

Here are some of the interesting posters that I saw today:


Random integration of AAV plasmid into the mouse genome following sub-retinal delivery

Cone inner-segment area and circularity in chorioderemia assessed with split-detection adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy

I talked with Peiluo (Angela) Xu about her findings. This study was performed on 13 CHM patients using [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics#:~:text=is%20actually%20detected.-,In%20retinal%20imaging,-%5Bedit%5D) and showed the following:
- The density of cones in CHM patients is __lower__ than controls
- The size of cones is larger in CHM patients
- The cones of CHM patients are __more circular__ than controls
- Inter-cone distance is __larger__ in CHM patients

Taken together, these findings make sense: when cones are tightly bunched together, they are likely to be smaller and less circular (more hexagonal). In CHM patients, becuase there are fewer cones, they have more room and are more like "blobs". 


Visualization of the Photoreceptor / RPE / Choriocapillaris Complex in Choroideremia Using Adaptive Optics Enhanced Indocyanine Green Imaging

In this study Nancy Aguilera examined the fovea (center) of the retina of CHM affected males and females. The study showed that the RPE was "disrupted" compared to control patients. However, the photoreceptors and choriocapillaris were fairly normal. They were also able to look at the same patients over time and saw that this RPE "disruption" increased.
