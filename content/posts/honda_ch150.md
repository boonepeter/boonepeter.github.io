![My 1987 Honda CH 150 moped](/imgs/honda/honda-ch150-1987.jpg)


I have a 1987 Honda Elite 150 (CH 150) "Spacey" moped that I love to cruise around on. I struggled to find a service manual online. So I bought a copy on Ebay and scaned all of the pages. I then ran it through [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) to make it easier to search. That PDF can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/boonepeter/boonepeter.github.io/blob/9f958f0eb3bba95699751b69aa9cf726ca270a9e/content/data/honda_ch150_elite_150_1987_manual_ocr.pdf?raw=true). If you want the raw scanned pdf it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/boonepeter/boonepeter.github.io/blob/9f958f0eb3bba95699751b69aa9cf726ca270a9e/content/data/honda_ch150_elite_150_1987_manual.zip?raw=true).

Hopefully by sharing it here I can help someone else.

Below is all of the OCR text from the service manual. The formatting is obviously terrible, but this should help others find this via Google.

 ‘IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE
Indicates a strong possibility of severe personal injury or loss of life if instructions are not followed.
CAUTION: Indicates a possibility of personal injury or equipment damage if instructions are not followed. NOTE: Gives helpful information.
Detailed descriptions of standard workshop procedures, safety principles and service operations are not included. It is important to note that this manual contains some warnings and cautions against some specific service methods which could cause PERSONAL INJURY to service personnel or could damagea vehicle or render it unsafe. Please understnad that those warnings could not cover all conceivable ways in which service, whether or not recommended by Honda might be done or of the possibly hazardous consequences of each conceivable way, nor could Honda investigate all such ways. Anyone using service procedures or tools, whether or not recommended by Honda must satisfy himself thoroughly that neither personal safety nor vehicle safety will be jeopardized by the service methods or tools selected.

 HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
Follow the Maintenance Schedule (Section 3) recommendations to ensure that the scooter is in peak operating condition and the emis- sion levels are within the standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. Perform- ing the first scheduled maintenance is very important. It compensates for the initial wear that occurs during the break-in period.
Sections 1 through 3 apply to the whole scooter, while sections 4 through 17 describe parts of the scooter, grouped according to lo- cation.
Find the section you want on this page, then turn to the table of contents on page 1 of that section.
Most sections start with an assembly or system illustration, service information and troubleshooting for the section. The subse- quent pages give detailed procedures.
If you don’t know the source of the trouble, go to section 18, TROUBLESHOOTING.
All information, illustration, directions and specifi- ;.

GENERAL SAFETY
If the engine must be running to do some work, make sure the area is well-ventilated. Never run the engine in a closed area. The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that may cause loss of consciousness and lead death.
Gasoline is extremelyflammable and is explosive under certain conditions. Do not smoke or allow flames or sparks in your working area.
SERVICE RULES
The battery electrolyte contains sulfuric acid. Protect your eyes, skin and clothing. In case of contact, flush thoroughly with water and call a doctor if electrolyte gets in your eyes.
The battery generates hydrogen gas which can be highly explo- sive. Do not smoke or allow flames or sparks near the battery, especially while charging it.
1, Use genuine Honda or Honda-recommended parts and lubricants or their equivalents. Parts that do not meet Honda’ design specifications may damage the scooter.
2. Use the special tools designed for this product.
3. Use only metric tools when servicing this scooter. Metric bolts, nuts, and screws are not interchangeable with English fas-
teners. The use of incorrect tools and fasteners may damage the scooter.
. Install new gaskets. O-rings, cotter pins, lock plates, etc. when reassembling.
of.
When tightening a senies of bolts or nuts, begin with larger-diameter or inner bolts first, and tighten to the specified torque diagonally, unless a particular sequence is specified.
[ep] .
Clean parts in cleaning solvent upon disassembly. Lubricate any sliding surfaces before reassembly.
.
After reassembly, check all parts for proper installation and operation.

 GENERAL INFORMATION
CABLE & HARNESS ROUTING
Note the following when routing cables and wire harnesses:
@ A loose wire, harness or cable can be safety hazard. After clamping, check each wire to be sure it is secure.
@ Do not squeeze wires against the weld or its clamp.
® Secure wires and wire harnesses to the frame with their te- spective wire bands at the designated locations. Tighten the bands so that only the insulated surfaces contact the wires or wire harnesses.
@ Route harnesses so they are neither pulled tight nor have excessive slack.
® Protect wires and harnesses with electrical tape or tube if they contact a sharp edge or corner.
Clean the attaching surface thoroughly before applying tape.
@ Do not use a wire or harness with a broken insulator. Repair by wrapping them with protective tape or replace them.
@ Route wire harnesses to avoid sharp edges or corners.
@ Avoid the projected ends of bolts and screws.
@ Keep wire harnesses away from the exhaust pipes and other hot parts.
® Be sure grommets are seated in their grooves properly.
@ After clamping, check each harness to be certain that it is not interfering with any moving or sliding parts.
@ After routing, check that the wire harnesses are not twisted or kinked.
@ Wire harnesses routed along the handlebars should not be pulled taut, have excessive slack, be pinched by or interfere with adjacent or surrounding parts in all steering positions.
@ After routing, check that the wire harnesses are not twisted or kinked.
®@ Do not bend or twist control cables. Damaged control cables will not operate smoothly and may stick or bind.

 GENERAL INFORMATION
EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board (CARB) require manufactures to certify that their motor scooters comply with applicable exhaust emissions standards during their useful life, when operated and main- tained according to the instructions provided, and that motor scooters built after January 1, 1983 comply with applicable noise emission standards for one year or 6,000 km (3,730 miles) after the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser, when oper- ated and maintained according to the instructions provided. Compliance with the terms of the Distributor’s Warranty for Honda Motor Scooter Emission Control Systems is necessary in order to keep the emissions system warranty in effect.
SOURCE OF EMISSIONS
The combustion process produces carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Control of hydrocarbons is very important because, under certain conditions, they react to form photochemical smog when subjected to sunlight. Carbon monoxide does not react in the same way, but it is toxic.
Honda Motor Co., Ltd. utilizes lean carburetor settings as well as other systems, to reduce carbon monoxide and hydro- carbons.
EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
The exhaust emission control system is composed of a lean carburetor setting, and no adjustments should be made except the idle speed adjustment with the throttle stop screw.
CRANKCASE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
The engine is equipped with a closed crankcase system which routes crankcase emissions through the air cleaner and into the combustion chamber. Condensed crankcase vapors are accumulated in a storage tank which must be emptied periodically. See the Maintenance Schedule in section 3.

Do not remove the radiator cap when the engine is hot. The coolant is underpressure and severe scalding could result. The engine must be cool before servicing the cooling system.
@
Use only distilled water and ethylene glycol in the cooling system. A 50—50 mixture is recommended for maximum corro- sion protection. Do not use alcohol-based antifreeze.
@
Add coolant at the reserve tank. Do not remove the radiator cap except to refill or drain the system.
@
The water pump must be serviced after removing the engine. Other cooling system service can be done with the engine in
the frame.
@ Avoid spilling coolant on painted surfaces.
@ After servcing the system, check for leaks with a cooling system tester.

SERVICE INFORMATION
GENERAL
C
@ Quick charge a battery, only in an emergency. Slow-charging is preferred.
@® Remove the battery from the scooter for charging. If the battery must be charged on the scooter, disconnect the battery
cables.
® The battery on this motorcycle is permanently sealed type. Never remove the filler hole caps even when the battery is
being charged.
@ Be sure to charge the battery with the amount of current and for the time indicated on the battery level and as given below.
Charging with excessive current and/or too fast may cause battery failue.
¢ Do not smoke, and keep flames away from a charging battery. The gas produced by a battery will explode ifflames or sparks are brought near.
@ Ignition timing cannot be adjusted. If the timing is incorrect, inspect the CDI unit and pulse generator and replace any faulty
@ Some wires have different colored bands around them near the connector. These are connected to other wires which cor- respond with the band color.
@ All plastic plugs have locking tabs that must be released before disconnecting, and must be aligned when reconnecting.
@ The following color codes used are indicated throughout this section and on the wiring diagram.
€
® To isolate an electrical failure, check the continuity of the electrical path through the part. A continuity check can usually be made without removing the part from the scooter. Simply disconnect the wires and connect a continuity tester or volt- ohmmeter to the terminals or connections.
@ A continuity tester is useful when checking to find out whether or not there is an electrical connection between two points. An ohmmeter is needed to measure the resistance of a circuit, such as when there is a specific coil resistance in- volved, or when checking for high resistance caused by corroded connections.

THERMOSTATIC SWITCH
The cooling fan motor is actuated by the thermostatic switch located in the radiator.
If the fan motor does not start, disconnect the Black and Blue leads from the thermostatic switch and short them together with a jumper wire as shown. Turn the ignition switch on. The cooling fan motor should start running.
If it does not start, check for battery voltage from the Blue lead (positive) to Green/Black (negative) of the fan motor coupler. If there is no voltage, check for a blown or faulty fuse, loose terminals or connectors, or an open circuit.
If it starts, inspect the fan thermostatic switch as follows:
Suspend the switch in a pan of coolant (50—50 mixture) and check the temperatures at which the switch opens and closes. Make sure that there is no switch comtinuity with room tem- perature and gradually raise the coolant temperature. The switch should have continuity (close) at 98—102°C (208— 215°F).
NOTE
e Keep temperature constant for 3 minutes before testing continuity. A sudden change of temperature will cause in- correct readings between the thermometer and the switch.
¢ Donot let the thermometer or switch touch the pan as it will give a false reading.
e Soak the switch in coolant up to its threads.
THERMOSENSOR Remove the thermosensor.
Suspend the sensor in oil over a burner and measure the resis- tance through the sensor as the oil heats up.

¢ Wear gloves and eye protection.
NOTE
* Oil must be used as the heated
liquid to check the function
above 100°C (212°F).
e« You'll get false readings if either the thermometer or
thermosensor touches the pan.
