What is Rab27? What is it's role in Choroideremia?

## Background

In my [previous post](https://boonepeter.github.io/2020/02/23/mrna-phenotype-review.html) I mentioned the central dogma of biology: DNA makes RNA which makes protein. DNA to RNA is called __transcription__, RNA to protein is called __translation__. After translation, proteins are often [modified to function differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification). Maybe a certain protein should be active, perhaps the cell would like a certain protein to go to the membrane, or possibly two proteins should be kept apart for a while. There is a _huge_ variety of modifications that occur within every cell. 

The type of modification that concerns Rab27 in the context of choroideremia, is called [__prenylation__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation). What is prenylation and what does it do? Prenylation is the addition of a __prenyl group__ to a protein. Naturally. Prenyl groups are hydrophobic molecules so they would like to leave water and sit comfortably with other hydrophobic molecules, like lipids. Attaching a prenyl group to a protein anchors that protein into a membrane in a cell.

### Terminology

__Prenylation__ - the addition of a hydrophobic prenyl group. This targets proteins to membranes.

[__Vesicle__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)) - 

__Organelle__ - 

# The three R's

[__Rab__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_(G-protein))

[__Rab escort protein__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15370541)

[__Rab geranylgeranyltransferase__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_geranylgeranyltransferase)

As their names imply, these 3 protein families function together.

### First, Rab proteins
There are over 70 kinds of Rab proteins. These proteins help membranes and vesicles traffic around the cell. For a cell to function it must absorb nutrients, secrete signals, transport proteins around itself, and complete many other trafficking related tasks. Without Rabs, these functions would be disrupted.
