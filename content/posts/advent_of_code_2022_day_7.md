I have fallen behind since day 6, but am attempting to make up some ground. 

Day 7 proved to be pretty tough. I kept track of the "current" directory by appending all of the `cd` commands. I then removed the directory before the `..`, ie `one/dir/..` -> `one`. I attempted to use a recursive regex for this, but unfortunatly BigQuery uses the [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) regex library which does not support recursive syntax. So instead I used a JavaScript UDF for that.

After finding the size of each directory, I then created a CTE with a row for each parent of a directory and the child's size. I then grouped by each of those directories to sum the sizes of all of the children. There might be a better way to do that, but that's the solution I arrived at.

Most of these solutions are ending up as a chain of transformations put into CTEs. ðŸ¤·

  while (directory.includes("..")) {
    directory = directory.replace(/,\w+,\.\./g, '');
    directory = '/' + directory.replace(/\/(,\.\.)?/g, '');

  }
  return directory;
