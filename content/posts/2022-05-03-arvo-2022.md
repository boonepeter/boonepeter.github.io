Meeting with FFB

Reliability and Reciprocity of the Population Cone Optoretinogram - Raymond Warner


Using non-viral S/MAR DNA vectors to restore protein expression in models of choroideremia - Lyes Toualbi

Injected S/MAR into single cell zebrafish and patient fibroblasts.
Why was the survival rate increase so low (normal zebrafish live many years). Lyes speculated that while we do see REP-1 expression in the retina of adult zebrafish, the expression may be lower. It is very cool to me that gene expression exists so late in life.

This study did not tackle the problem of delivery. 


Characterization of fluorescently labeled photoreceptors observed in carriers of choroideremia using multimodal adaptive optics

Andrew Bower

Did not observe this lebeling in CHM males - why?

Reliability and Reciprocity of the Population Cone Optoretinogram - Raymond Warner

Very good presentation - well formatted videos that showed the stimulus and behavior of individual photoreceptors.
