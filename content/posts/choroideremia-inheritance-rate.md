> It seems like there are a lot of families here who have more than 50% of their children affected by choroideremia. Are we sure the inheritance rate is 50%? Not 60-70%?

A comment along these lines was made at a Choroideremia Research Foundation conference recently and it got me thinking. It __did__ seem like a lot of families had 3/4 children or 4/4 children who were either carriers or were affected. Let's explore this.

## Background

Choroideremia is an X-linked disease. This means the mutation that causes the disease is on the X chromosome. Since males only have one X chromosome, if they inherit a CHM mutation they experience the full symptoms of choroideremia. Females who inherit a CHM mutation have another copy of "healthy" CHM, so they ususally do not experience noticable symptoms. 

A male or female who has a CHM mutation will pass it on to roughly 50% of their children. But because the X and Y chromosomes determine biological sex, the gender of the children who can inherit the mutation is different. A male will pass it on to __all__ of his daughters and __none__ of his sons. A female will pas it on to __50%__ of her daughters and __50%__ of her sons.

## Unnatural Selection

The >50% ratio that we see at CRF conferences is likely because there is self-selection done when chosing to attend. Families who have zero children who are affected by choroideremia are unlikely to bring them to a CRF conference. This would skew the ratio of affected children up.

Another important detail is that the number of children that families have in the US is not a normal distribution. This map shows the average number of children by state:

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183790/number-of-families-in-the-us-by-number-of-children/) most
