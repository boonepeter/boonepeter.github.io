Purpose of the article:

Audience:
Scientists who want to switch over to tech

What:
Describe my journey - mention all of the things I've done along the way
Comprehensive list
You cannot learn everything
There is not a "correct" way to learn things. I realize that this list could be taken as a guide...
You don't have to have been coding from an early age

Big takeaways:
This is possible
Prioritize yourself

Linear algebra - tried + failed

Around this time I was applying to a variety of jobs. Many of the jobs I was applying to were a mixture of software development and wet lab work.

I came across Cell Mycrosystems - a company local to the Research Triangle and applied in April 2019. The interview consisted of a phone screen, an in person round, and I gave a short presentation of the image processing work I had been doing in the lab. There was not really a technical interview - simply a discussion about what I was comfortable with and what the company was working on.

The company built lab instruments that were controlled by a Windows desktop application. I did not know what C# or WPF was - but I brought a little bit of image processing experience and I had a science background so they were willing to "take a risk" on me.

Cell Microsystems was a very formative experience for me. The engineering department consisted of me, my manager, and his son. I started out contributing to the existing desktop application. It was helpful to have an existing codebase in front of me to be able to work on. It exposed me to
