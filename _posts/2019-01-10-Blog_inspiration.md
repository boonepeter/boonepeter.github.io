So there I was, in July 2018, searching for information on how often germline mutations occur when I stumbled across [Eric Minikel's website](http://www.cureffi.org/). He had a great post that answered some questions I had. I poked around his site a little more since the post was clean and explained things well. I read about Sonia's story and what the two of them were doing about her disease.

I was particularly impressed with Eric's archive. It is an awesome way to open up barriers that exist in research so more can understand. Instead of fighting with jargon and paywalls, people with CJD can go to Eric's site and learn while he learns.
