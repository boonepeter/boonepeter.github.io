## Introduction
This site is built using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the [Jekyll Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Some inspiration for the site comes from Eric Minikel's [cureffi.org](http://www.cureffi.org) both in content and layout. He and Sonia are inspirational people that I recommend everyone follow and aspire to be a little more like.
