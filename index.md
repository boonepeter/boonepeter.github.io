# About me
I am a molecular biologist by training and have spent 3+ years working on the bench and with confocal microscopes. To deal with large imaging datasets and single-cell sequencing data I have learned Python and how to use some of its scientific packages. These include:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
* [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
