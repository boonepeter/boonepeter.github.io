## About me
I have an eye disease called choroideremia which I write about on this site. I volunteer for the [Choroideremia Research Foundation](https://www.curechm.org/) in my free time.

I have a BS in molecular biology, and worked at Duke as a research tech/analyst for 4 years. The project I worked on can be found here: [A cancer rainbow mouse for visualizing the functional genomics of oncogenic clonal expansion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13330-y).

I then worked as a software engineer for [Cell Microsystems](https://cellmicrosystems.com/). In this role I worked on desktop applications to control automated microscopes. I worked in C# and did a lot of UI, machine control, and image processing.

I currently work at [Benchsci](https://www.benchsci.com/) where we are building better ways for scientists to search and perform experiments. I write some SQL and Python, and try to model and process data.
