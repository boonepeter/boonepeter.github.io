## About me
I have an eye disease called choroideremia which I write about on this site. Science, stories, resources, and thoughts. I volunteer for the [Choroideremia Research Foundation](https://www.curechm.org/) in my free time.

I have a BS in molecular biology, and worked at Duke as a research tech/analyst for 4 years. The project I worked on can be found here: [A cancer rainbow mouse for visualizing the functional genomics of oncogenic clonal expansion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13330-y).

I now work as a software engineer for [Cell Microsystems](https://cellmicrosystems.com/). So far, I have focused mainly on image processing, hardware control, and desktop UI development. 

## The name
**[boon·dog·gle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondoggle) /ˈbo͞onˌdäɡəl/ (noun)** -- *work or activity that is wasteful or pointless but gives the appearance of having value.*

I don't think this work is pointless, but it's a fun word that works well with my last name.
