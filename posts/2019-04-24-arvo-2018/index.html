On the floors above the exhibit hall presentations were given simultaneously in small auditoriums. Each presentation session included 5-6 speakers who presented work for 15 minutes on a given topic.

Researchers presented cell-based therapies as a way of using stem cells to restore vision or protect the remaining healthy retina. These cells can be injected as a suspension or implanted on a thin scaffold as a sheet. Other work focused on gene therapy. This work included ongoing clinical trials as well as basic research to improve the vector or delivery mechanism. Gene therapy is the treatment which is furthest along in development and the interest in it was noticeable. Dr. Robert MacLaren’s presentation on Nightstar’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with choroideremia needed an overflow room to contain the interest.

The science that was presented across the conference was exciting and promising. The awareness of choroideremia continues to grow within the scientific community thanks to the ongoing clinical trials and the work of the CRF.\nIn addition to exploring the science being presented, the CRF representatives were busy networking. This networking took place in scheduled meetings with companies and current researchers as well as spontaneously in front of posters and after presentations, often with people who had never heard of the CRF. The primary reason the CRF went to ARVO was to interface with these scientists and companies, coming alongside anyone and everyone who can help push the work towards a cure for Choroideremia forward.

<p>I will be attending ARVO 2019 shortly, so here is my experience from the 2018 conference that I wrote last year.

<p>The annual meeting of ARVO (the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology) took
place in Honolulu, Hawaii from April 28 to May 3, and was attended by over 11,000 researchers and
clinicians. The CRF was represented by foundation president Dr. Chris Moen, Randy Wheelock, and Peter
Boone. The conference was hosted in the Honolulu convention center which was a beautiful, semi open

hall more than 1,000 new posters were hung up every day, outlining smaller experiments and studies.
