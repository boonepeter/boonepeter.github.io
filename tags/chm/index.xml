      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since the Human Genome Project. This effort to sequence the human genome for the first time was a tremendous achievement that lasted 13 (ish) years and cost $3 billion dollars. Thanks to this pioneering work and major advancements over the years it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to get your own genome sequenced for $300 in a few months.
That&amp;rsquo;s a 10,000x decrease in cost! If the price of homes decreased at a similar rate since 1990, the median home would cost $7.</description>

A question was posted in the Choroideremia (CHM) Facebook group about supplements:
Hello to all my fellow group mates. Just wanted some input as to what vitamins or supplements you are taking to help with CHM. I have been taking the Bausch and Lomb preservision and would like to know if there is something better or something additional you would recommend.</description>
