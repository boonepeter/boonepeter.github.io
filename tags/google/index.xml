      <description>I was reading a post about BigQuery cost optimization which stated this:
 Also remember you are charged for bytes processed in the first stage of query execution. Avoid creating a complex multistage query just to optimize for bytes processed in the intermediate stages, since there are no cost implications anyway (though you may achieve performance gains).
 I was curious about this, because I have written some queries to minimize reading data multiple times.</description>
