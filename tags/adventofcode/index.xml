      <description>I have fallen behind since day 6, but am attempting to make up some ground.
Day 7 proved to be pretty tough. I kept track of the &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; directory by appending all of the cd commands. I then removed the directory before the .., ie one/dir/.. -&amp;gt; one. I attempted to use a recursive regex for this, but unfortunatly BigQuery uses the re2 regex library which does not support recursive syntax.</description>

      <description>Okay, hope in SQL has been temporarily restored. This problem fits SQL a bit better so I did not have to do anything too wild. For part 2, I decided to copy/past LAG(4) - LAG(13). There might be a better way to do it but I decided to keep it simple for myself.

      <description>Oof, this one was rough. This may be the start of the end for my SQL Advent of Code journey. I tried a few different approaches before &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; and falling back on a Javascript UDF. This code is a mess and I would definitly not recommend reading it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the stomach to go back and read it myself to clean it up.

      <description>This year, I am be taking a page out of Felipe Hoffa&amp;rsquo;s book and will be attempting to complete the Advent of Code using BigQuery SQL. Until I reach the point where I can&amp;rsquo;t solve the puzzles with SQL, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep track of things here.
Day 1 WITH raw_input AS ( /* To start, I just copy/paste the input as a raw text string, and then parse that string into rows.</description>
