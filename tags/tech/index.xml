      <description>I was reading a post about BigQuery cost optimization which stated this:
 Also remember you are charged for bytes processed in the first stage of query execution. Avoid creating a complex multistage query just to optimize for bytes processed in the intermediate stages, since there are no cost implications anyway (though you may achieve performance gains).
 I was curious about this, because I have written some queries to minimize reading data multiple times.</description>

      <description>Background Earlier this year I made my way through Fullstack Open, a course designed to teach modern Javascript-based web development.
In their words:
 The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs. The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.</description>

      <description>Spotify Codes are QR-like codes that can be generated to easily share Spotify songs, artists, playlists, and users. I set out to figure out how they worked, which led me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.
Spotify URIs Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.
The ABBA song &amp;ldquo;Take a Chance on Me&amp;rdquo; has this URI:</description>
