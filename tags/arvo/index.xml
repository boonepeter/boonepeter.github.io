      <description>The 2022 ARVO conference is taking place in Denver, CO. I am excited to be there networking and learning from the scientists in the field. Here are a few of the Choroideremia related posters and talks that I will be checking out:
Sunday Cone inner-segment area and circularity in chorioderemia assessed with split-detection adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy - Peiluo Xu CHM cones are bigger and more circular.
Visualization of the Photoreceptor / RPE / Choriocapillaris Complex in Choroideremia Using Adaptive Optics Enhanced Indocyanine Green Imaging - Nancy Aguilera The RPE was the most disrupted layer.</description>

      <description>ARVO poster area B. Roughly 1,000 new posters are displayed every day of ARVO.
See my notes from Sunday and Monday.
Patient Engagement in Ophthalmology Research This special interest group discussed current methods of patient involvement in research and explored new ways this could be improved. A special emphasis was put on international policies, specifically in Europe and Canada. BC SUPPORT is one of the branches of the SPOR initiative across Canada meant to include patients and caregivers in research design.</description>

These are my notes from the second day at ARVO 2019. Check out Sunday&amp;rsquo;s notes if you missed them.
Changing What it Means to be Blind: We&amp;rsquo;re All in This Together This session took place late in the evening and was put together by Kristin Smedley from the Curing Retinal Blindness Foundation.

A few words Similar to my article about the FFB Innovation Summit this post is a gathering of my notes from ARVO 2019. I will not be explaining topics, instead this is meant to be a reference for myself and others within the CRF. However I want these notes to be available to everyone since I think it is vitally important for those affected by disease to be invited into the discussion about research.</description>

      <description>Retinal Cell and Gene Therapy Innovation Summit The 6th annual Innovation Summit organized by the Foundation Fighting Blindness and the Casey Eye Institute at OHSU was packed with exciting research and over 300 attendees. The summit took place in Vancuover, CA on April 26 just before ARVO. I will highlight some research that was relevant to Choroideremia and a few notes on the work.
